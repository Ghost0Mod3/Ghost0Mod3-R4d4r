# Ghost0Mod3

Ghost0Mod3 is a Raspberry Pi based Wi-Fi reconnaissance and network awareness platform built around Scapy, monitor mode capture, and a lightweight Tkinter user interface.

The project is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi 4 with a dedicated wireless adapter operating in monitor mode.

---

## Features

- Live Wi-Fi network discovery
- Monitor mode packet capture
- Real-time network list
- Network classification
- RSSI tracking
- Target selection
- Target persistence
- Channel hopping
- Raspberry Pi optimized deployment
- Desktop launcher integration

---

## Hardware

Recommended:

- Raspberry Pi 4
- External Wi-Fi adapter with monitor mode support
- 7" Raspberry Pi display
- Vehicle-mounted or portable power source

Tested with:

- wlan0 for management
- wlan1 for monitor mode capture

---

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ghost0Mod3/Ghost0Mod3.git
cd Ghost0Mod3
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running

Launch manually:

```bash
sudo -E python3 main.py
```

---

## Desktop Launchers

Install desktop launchers:

```bash
chmod +x install_desktop_launcher.sh
./install_desktop_launcher.sh
```

This creates:

```text
Ghost0Mod3.desktop
Ghost0Mod3 Shutdown.desktop
```

on the Raspberry Pi desktop.

---

## Monitor Mode

Verify monitor mode:

```bash
iw dev
```

Expected:

```text
Interface wlan1
type monitor
```

---

## Target Tracking

Ghost0Mod3 supports:

- Selecting a target network
- Saving a target
- Reloading previously selected targets

Target information is stored in:

```text
data/target.json
```

---

## Legacy Components

The original SOPHIA application and associated launcher files have been archived under:

```text
legacy/
```

These files are preserved for reference but are not part of the active Ghost0Mod3 application.

---

## Status

Current Phase:

```text
Alpha
```

Working:


- Packet capture
- Monitor mode
- Channel hopping
- Classification
- Target management
- Raspberry Pi deployment
- Desktop launchers
## Supported Operating Systems

Officially Tested:

- Raspberry Pi OS


Expected Compatibility:

- Debian
- Ubuntu
- Linux Mint
- Kali Linux

Not Supported:

- Windows
- macOS

Ghost0Mod3 relies on:

- Python 3
- Scapy
- Linux monitor mode support
- aircrack-ng
- iw
- wireless-tools
Planned:

- Improved target panel
- Radar audio notifications
- Confidence scoring
- Distance estimation
- Vehicle deployment profile
